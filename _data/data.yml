    summary: |
      I am a full stack web developer motivated by meaningful work. During my six years
      of web development experience I quickly and independently became familiar
      with new programming concepts and paradigms to accomplish business goals.
      
      My clients and colleagues valued the independence and attention to detail I showed in my work.

      - name: Talkjaw
        time: "May 2020"
        tagline: "A public conversations platform that streams phone calls to listeners."
        details: |
            Talkjaw is a web browser analog to the popular Clubhouse app. I created it in a little over three weeks. You can create a room, or join a room. Once you're in a room, you can join the conversation by calling in.
            - Took advantage of the Nexmo voice platform to establish conference calls and stream raw audio data to browsers.
            - Created revenue model for reserving room names so that only the owner of a room name could start calls in that room.
            - Incorporated Twitter API to allow users to verify their Twitter handle and have it attached to their profile when speaking in a room.
            - Leveraged Phoenix Presence, PubSub, and LiveView to show the people currently in a room and allow them to send a speak request to the room's moderator.
            
      - name: Family Blessings Phone
        time: "March 2020 - April 2020"
        tagline: "A gratitude voice journal for families to share things that they're grateful for."
        details: |
            This concept came about during my enrollment in an online course from Yale called the Science of Well-Being. The course material introduced me to a family blessings journal where family members write down something good that happened to them every day. I challenged myself to complete this project within two weeks and succeeded.
            - Used my knowledge of telecom programming to make the journal voice-based and reachable by phone.
            - Designated whitelist security protocols to protect private content of users.
            - Prioritized development of a simple calling interface to record and play voice messages that children can understand. 
            
      - name: People's Voicemail
        time: "October 2018 - March 2020"
        tagline: "A public voicemail box that functions as a voice-based community forum."
        details: |
            I built this application to make politicians’ community communications more transparent and engaging.
            - Integrated with Plivo to provide customers with their own phone number to take calls from constituents
                - I decided to use Plivo instead of Twilio because it was cheaper but still had exceptional documentation.
            - Used AWS Transcribe and AWS Comprehend to process incoming voicemails
                - I created a couple of AWS Lambda functions to first transcribe a message, and then used the natural language processing capabilities of Comprehend to extract key phrases and sentiment.
                - This provided customers with a way to see at a glance what the primary concerns of their constituents are without having to listen to a voicemail in its entirety.
            - Created custom caller menu that uses uniquely generated extensions for replying to a voicemail
                - Assigning transient extensions to voicemails was my solution for supporting threaded conversations.
            - Added Stripe payment processing to facilitate monthly subscription plans that include variable usage costs
                - Given that my costs were based on the number of calls a customer receives, pricing it with a flat monthly fee could have ended up costing me more than a customer was paying me.
            - Supported time-anchored user reactions for voicemail messages
                - On top of providing an interactive feature for lurkers to engage with, the exact time of where users react during the playback of a voicemail can signal to a customer what their audience deems important.
            - Implemented a voter verification process so that voicemails from registered U.S. voters are evident
                - Akin to Twitter verified accounts, this feature makes voicemails from legit voters easy to identify so that a customer can trust the source of a voicemail isn’t a bot or Russian troll, but is a bonafide constituent.

      - name: A Real Talk
        time: "October 2017 - June 2018"
        tagline: "A tool for organizing small meetups between 3-4 people to discuss community affairs."
        details: |
            I developed A Real Talk as an alternative to traditional town hall meetings. Instead of one central monthly meeting, meetups are decentralized and self-organized by stakeholders. Scaling down the meetings allowed for using new venues like cafes and bars.
            - Integrated Google's geocoding service to convert addresses and ZIP codes to coordinates that were then used to query nearby talks
                - This application was predominantly about location so enabling PostGIS on the database allowed searching for geographical objects.
            - Implemeneted passwordless authentication scheme that used magic login links to sign in
                - Given that users are already inundated with usernames and passwords, I went for the alternative solution here of letting users login with only an email address.
                - I decided that users having one less thing to remember was worth the trade-off of checking their email once every couple of weeks.
            - Provided a robust email notification system for letting users know when a talk reached the required number of users
                - This was an important function because the way talks were organized, you wouldn't know if a talk was confirmed to happen or not until at least 2 other people RSVP'd.
            - Developed private chatrooms for talks that would become available only to attendees once a talk reached the minimum number of participants
                - By spawning chatrooms for confirmed upcoming talks, last-minute changes or coordination details could be discussed among the participants.
      - name: Ensure Healthcare
        time: "July 2017 - August 2017"
        tagline: "A website for an insurance agency."
        details: |
            I redesigned an insurance agency's website to run faster and look more professional to prospective customers. [[view staging site]](https://ensurehealth.herokuapp.com/)
            - Developed responsive website from scratch as a single page app to be lightning fast
                - Original site was made with a Wix template that loaded slowly and looked very homemade.
                - I knew it was important to make a professional first impression to visitors with a savvy and clean design. Doing so improves the company's credibility.
            - Recreated brand logo and sourced other business logos to provide higher resolution images
            - Made the business phone number into a telephone link for prospects to conveniently call
                - Every little thing you can do to reduce the number of steps a user needs to take to accomplish a task improves user experience.
        
      - name: Rom
        time: "October 2016 - April 2017"
        tagline: "An e-commerce store for a modern pixel art brand."
        details: |
            I worked closely with the brand's artist to develop a tech-centric theme that captured the essence of the brand. [[view staging site]](https://pxrom.herokuapp.com/)
            - Fashioned a custom arcade-like future dystopia game
                - I felt that a simple about page wouldn't do the brand justice so I wrote a choose-your-own-adventure game to enthrall users.
                - I also incorporated gifs in the game because it was lacking a visual element and they fit the bill perfectly.
            - Animated brand logo on homepage to slide down like a tetris block
                - Nice little touches like this throughout the site helped to sell the theme and experience.
            - Created a unique shop and an administrative panel so client could easily control their inventory
                - The admin panel was developed so that the client could add or remove products at their own convenience.
                - I used AWS S3 for storing product images and configured the site's DNS through Cloudflare which allowed me to create my own content delivery network with cached assets.
            - Built a shopping cart component that updated in real-time across browser tabs and allowed for multiple payment gateways

skills:
    - Superior analytical and problem-solving abilities, with a knack for improving existing processes
    - Proven ability to diagnose, troubleshoot, and resolve technical problems
    - Outstanding communication skills
