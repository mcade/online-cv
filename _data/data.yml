    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a software engineer motivated by working on meaningful projects
      that add value to society and advance technology. During my six years
      of web development experience I quickly and independently became familiar
      with new programming concepts and paradigms. My clients and colleagues
      valued the independence and attention to detail I showed in my work.
      
      My latest and most ambitious endeavors have been entrepreneurial in nature
      at the intersection of technology and politics. It is my firm belief that
      the best way to advance global culture is through a mixture of technological
      and institutional progress.
