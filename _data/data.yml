      I am a full stack web developer motivated by working on meaningful projects
      that add value to society and advance the status quo. During my six years
      of web development experience I quickly and independently became familiar

      - name: People's Voicemail
        time: "October 2018 - Present"
        tagline: "A public voicemail box that functions as a voice-based community forum."
        details: |
            I built this application to make politicians’ community communications more transparent and engaging.
            - Integrated with Plivo to provide customers with their own phone number to take calls from constituents
                - I decided to use Plivo instead of Twilio because it was cheaper but still had exceptional documentation.
            - Used AWS Transcribe and AWS Comprehend to process incoming voicemails
                - I created a couple of AWS Lambda functions to first transcribe a message, and then used the natural language processing capabilities of Comprehend to extract key phrases and sentiment.
                - This provided customers with a way to see at a glance what the primary concerns of their constituents are without having to listen to a voicemail in its entirety.
            - Created custom caller menu that uses uniquely generated extensions for replying to a voicemail
                - Assigning transient extensions to voicemails was my solution for supporting threaded conversations.
            - Added Stripe payment processing to facilitate monthly subscription plans that include variable usage costs
                - Given that my costs were based on the number of calls a customer receives, pricing it with a flat monthly fee could have ended up costing me more than a customer was paying me.
            - Supported time-anchored user reactions for voicemail messages
                - On top of providing an interactive feature for lurkers to engage with, the exact time of where users react during the playback of a voicemail can signal to a customer what their audience deems important.
            - Implemented a voter verification process so that voicemails from registered U.S. voters are evident
                - Akin to Twitter verified accounts, this feature makes voicemails from legit voters easy to identify so that a customer can trust the source of a voicemail isn’t a bot or Russian troll, but is a bonafide constituent.

      - name: A Real Talk
        time: "October 2017 - June 2018"
        tagline: "A tool for organizing small meetups between 3-4 people to discuss community affairs."
        details: |
            I developed A Real Talk as an alternative to traditional town hall meetings. Instead of one central monthly meeting, meetups were decentralized and self-organized.
